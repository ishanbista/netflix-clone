# Netflix-Clone
This is a responsive Netflix clone that I made using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to recreate the user interface (UI) of the Netflix Nepal homepage. The layout is fully responsive, adjusting for different screen sizes such as mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Features
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Hero section with background image and title
- Sections for "Trending Now with placeholder images", "FAQ", "More Reasons to Join"
- Navigation bar with hover effects
- Footer with links and a similar design to the official Netflix site
